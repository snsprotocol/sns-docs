# How SNS Works

The **Sonic Name Service (SNS)** is poised to revolutionize decentralized name services on the [**Sonic blockchain**](https://soniclabs.com), offering users and developers a streamlined and efficient way to manage `.s` domains. This guide provides an overview of how SNS will function once it is officially launched.

#### **1. Overview of Name Registration**

Once SNS is live, users will be able to register their desired `.s` domains on the Sonic blockchain. Here’s how the registration process will work:

* **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**\
  Upon launch, users will be able to connect their Web3-compatible wallets to the Sonic blockchain to interact with SNS.
* **Step 2: Search for Available Names**\
  Through the SNS interface, users can search for their desired `.s` domain. The system will check if the name is available for registration.
* **Step 3: Pay the Registration Fee**\
  Registration will be quick and affordable, with fees kept low due to Sonic’s efficient transaction model. Once the registration fee is paid, the `.s` domain will be yours.
* **Step 4: Assign Resources**\
  After securing a domain, users can assign blockchain addresses, smart contracts, or other resources to their `.s` domain. These resources can be updated as needed through the SNS management platform.

#### **2. Name Resolution**

SNS will provide a seamless name resolution service, translating human-readable `.s` domains into blockchain addresses. Here’s what users can expect:

* **Instant Resolution**\
  With Sonic’s ultra-fast finality, SNS will resolve `.s` domains to addresses in less than a second, making blockchain interactions more user-friendly. [Why Sonic?](why-sonic.md)
* **Cross-Chain Integration**\
  SNS will be compatible with multiple blockchains through the **Sonic Gateway**, allowing `.s` names to resolve assets not only on Sonic but also on Ethereum and other networks.

#### **3. Managing `.s` Domains**

Once SNS is operational, managing `.s` domains will be straightforward and user-friendly:

* **Renewal**:\
  Users will be able to renew their domain registrations before they expire. The cost of renewal will remain minimal due to Sonic’s low transaction fees.
* **Transfers**:\
  Users can transfer ownership of `.s` domains to other parties through the SNS platform, enabling smooth domain exchanges.
* **Update Resources**:\
  The platform will allow for easy updates to the resources linked to a domain. Whether linking a new blockchain address or updating metadata, changes will be processed quickly and efficiently.

#### **4. Developer Integration**

Developers will be able to integrate SNS into their decentralized applications using Sonic’s developer-friendly tools:

* **APIs and SDKs**\
  SNS will provide APIs and SDKs that allow developers to integrate name resolution into their dApps. This will make it easy for applications to use `.s` domains to interact with blockchain addresses.
* **EVM Compatibility**\
  Since Sonic is EVM-compatible, developers can use existing Ethereum tools like Solidity and Vyper to build or migrate their projects to Sonic without major changes in their codebase.

#### **5. User Experience**

SNS is designed to offer a user-friendly experience once launched:

* **Intuitive Interface**\
  Upon launch, users will interact with SNS through a clean and simple interface, making it easy to manage domains, update resources, and track domain expirations.
* **Wallet Integration**\
  SNS will integrate with popular Web3 wallets, allowing users to securely manage their domains and link them to their blockchain assets with ease.

#### **Conclusion**

As the Sonic blockchain prepares for its launch, the **Sonic Name Service (SNS)** will soon provide a fast, affordable, and scalable way to manage decentralized domains. Whether you’re a user looking to register a `.s` domain or a developer planning to integrate SNS into your dApps, the service will offer the tools and infrastructure needed to make decentralized name services seamless and accessible.
