#### **1. Speed and Efficiency**

Sonic is built to deliver unparalleled speed, handling **over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS)** with **sub-second transaction finality**. This means that all domain-related actions, from registrations to updates, are processed almost instantly. The reduced latency ensures a seamless user experience, even during times of high network demand.

#### **2. Minimal Transaction Costs**

One of the standout features of Sonic is its **extremely low transaction fees**. With transaction costs averaging **less than $0.01**, users can interact with the network frequently without the burden of high costs. This affordability opens up decentralized name services to a wider range of users, making operations such as name registration, renewal, and transfers more accessible and predictable.

#### **3. Scalability for the Future**

Scalability is at the core of Sonic’s design. With its **EVM compatibility** and **advanced node architecture**, Sonic allows for effortless scaling while maintaining network stability and speed. Highlights include:

* **10x faster node synchronization**,
* **66% lower validator costs**,
* **Reduced storage requirements** for operating nodes.

This makes Sonic well-suited for hosting a large-scale name service like SNS, which needs to accommodate growing user demands without compromising on performance.

#### **4. Cross-Chain Compatibility**

Sonic is more than just a standalone Layer-1 blockchain. Through its **Sonic Gateway**, it provides seamless integration with Ethereum and other networks, enabling access to a wider ecosystem while benefiting from Sonic’s lower fees and faster speeds. This cross-chain compatibility ensures that users and developers can interact with other blockchain assets and protocols while enjoying the advantages of Sonic’s infrastructure.

#### **5. Developer Incentives and Ecosystem Support**

Sonic offers a variety of incentive programs that encourage rapid development and innovation. Programs like the **Innovator Fund**, with up to **200 million S tokens**, and the **Fee Monetization** model, which allows developers to earn up to **90% of the fees** generated by their applications, provide strong incentives for building on the network. For SNS, this means continuous improvements and support as more developers and projects join the ecosystem.

#### **6. Enhanced Security and Decentralization**

Security is a key consideration for any blockchain project. Sonic’s **Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)** consensus mechanism ensures that the network is highly secure and resilient to attacks. Combined with **lower costs for validator nodes** and a decentralized staking model, Sonic offers a robust environment for managing decentralized name services.

#### **7. Efficient Storage Solutions**

Sonic is designed with **significant storage optimizations**, which contribute to its scalability and long-term sustainability. The network utilizes advanced **live-pruning** and **low-latency database structures**, reducing storage requirements for validators and other network participants by up to **96%** compared to traditional blockchain systems​. This results in lower costs for running nodes and makes operating on Sonic much more efficient.

For the **Sonic Name Service (SNS)**, this means that managing large numbers of domain registrations and associated metadata is more cost-effective and sustainable over time. The ability to prune old or unnecessary data while maintaining fast access to important records ensures that SNS can grow without the risk of excessive storage costs or reduced performance. This scalability is essential as the number of `.s` domains and users increases, making Sonic an ideal choice for a long-term decentralized name service.

#### **Conclusion: The Future of Naming Services with Sonic**

The Sonic blockchain provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications with its combination of speed, low costs, and scalability. As the infrastructure behind the **Sonic Name Service (SNS)**, it ensures a smooth, efficient, and secure experience for users and developers alike, positioning SNS as a leader in decentralized name services. With Sonic’s advanced capabilities, the future of blockchain-based name services is bright and full of possibilities.
