# SNS Roadmap

As we approach the official launch of the **Sonic Name Service (SNS)**, we are excited to share our development roadmap. This roadmap outlines the key milestones, phases, and future plans for SNS and the **Sonic blockchain**. It provides a clear path forward, ensuring that our community stays informed and engaged at every step of the way.

#### **Phase 1: Burn-to-Mint on WigoSwap**

* **Timeline**: Exact date to be announced
* **Details**: The SNS token will first be introduced through the **burn-to-mint mechanism** on **WigoSwap**. In this phase, users will burn WIGO tokens to mint new SNS tokens, which will help strengthen the value of the token.
  * **Platform**: WigoSwap
  * **Mechanism**: Burn existing WIGO tokens to mint SNS tokens.

#### **Phase 2: SNS Token IDO on Fantom**

* **Timeline**: Post burn-to-mint
* **Details**: After the burn-to-mint event, the SNS token will be distributed via an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on the **Fantom network**. Early adopters and supporters will have the opportunity to acquire the SNS token, which will be used within the SNS ecosystem.
  * **Token Symbol**: SNS
  * **Platform**: Fantom
  * **Use Cases**: Staking, governance, and more.

#### **Phase 3: Mainnet Launch of Sonic Blockchain**

* **Timeline**: Expected in late 2024
* **Details**: The full launch of the **Sonic blockchain** will provide the infrastructure necessary for the **Sonic Name Service**. Once the Sonic network goes live, users will also be able to **migrate their SNS tokens from Fantom to Sonic**, enabling full participation in the Sonic ecosystem.

#### **Phase 4: SNS Platform Launch on Sonic**

* **Timeline**: Shortly after the Sonic mainnet launch
* **Details**: The SNS platform will go live, allowing users to fully utilize the service by registering `.s` domains, managing their names, and integrating with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Sonic blockchain. Additionally, SNS will introduce a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** that will empower token holders to participate in governance decisions, ensuring a community-driven development process for the platform.
  * **DAO Features**:
    * Token holders can vote on governance proposals.
    * Influence over future upgrades and platform decisions.

#### **Phase 5: Ecosystem Development**

* **Partnerships and Collaborations**:\
  To expand the SNS ecosystem, partnerships with projects across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 will be a priority. Collaborations with wallets, dApps, and platforms that integrate SNS will drive user adoption and create new use cases for `.s` domains.
* **Developer Incentives**:\
  **SNS Protocol** will offer an **incentive program** for builders integrating the SNS protocol into decentralized applications. Developers will be eligible for grants based on the impact and innovation of their projects, and they’ll have access to technical support, APIs, and SDKs. Successful projects will also gain visibility through community promotion and marketing channels, fostering growth and innovation within the SNS ecosystem.

#### **Phase 6: Future Enhancements and Features**

* **Ongoing Development**: The SNS team is committed to enhancing the platform with features such as:
  * **Enhanced Metadata Integration**: Link social profiles, avatars, and other metadata to `.s` domains.
  * **Governance Model**: Token holders will have a voice in platform governance and future development.
  * **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Continued expansion of cross-chain integrations beyond Ethereum via the Sonic Gateway.
